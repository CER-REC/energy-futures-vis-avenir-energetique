# Share

This component is used to download the data and share shortened links to the visualization.

This file contains two components. One is the collection of buttons that are used to share shortened links to the visualization.
The other is to create a csv file, and prompt the user to download.
## Examples


```jsx

    <Grid item style={{ width: 40 }}><Share /></Grid>


```

```jsx

    <Grid item><DownloadButton accent /></Grid>

```

## Requirements

The download button requires that the bitly url shortening service is set up properly and is taking requests.
