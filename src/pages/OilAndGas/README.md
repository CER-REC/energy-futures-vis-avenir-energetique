# Page Oil-and-Gas

The `oil-and-gas` page facilities a collection of treemaps to demonstrate oil and gas productions over entire Canada. Users can select a base year and a compare year and the graph renders the corresponding visualization for both years, and treemaps are perfectly aligned for easier visual comparison. In addition, the base year can be auto-played using the year slider.

- select all sources or a single source to show the corresponding type of data in the chart
- update the base year and the compare year individually with the year slider
