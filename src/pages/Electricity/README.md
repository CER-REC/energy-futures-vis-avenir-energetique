# Page Electricity

The `electricity` page facilities customized bubble charts to demonstrate the electricity production of Canada. Grouped by either regions or sources based on the user selection, each bubble group uses the area of circles to visualize not only the overall volume (transparent circle in the middle) but also the volumes in each sub-category (colored circles around).

There are 2 views in the `electricity` visualization: multi-group view and single-group view. The multi-group view shows all the bubble groups at once, while the single-group view focuses on the single selected bubble group.
