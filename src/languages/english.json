        "description": "Canada’s Energy Future 2023: Energy Supply and Demand Projections to 2050 (EF2023) is the latest long-term energy outlook from the Canada Energy Regulator (CER). The Canada’s Energy Future series explores how possible energy futures might unfold for Canadians over the long term. EF2023 focuses on the challenge of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. We explore net-zero scenarios to help Canadians and policy makers see what a net-zero world could look like, visualize the goal, and make informed decisions. Our scenarios cover all energy commodities and all Canadian provinces and territories. We use economic and energy models to do this analysis.\n\nEF2023 contains three scenarios. Two of these scenarios explore pathways where Canada achieves net-zero emissions by 2050. In the **Global Net-zero Scenario**, we assume Canada achieves net-zero emissions by 2050. We also assume the rest of the world reduces emissions enough to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius (°C). In the **Canada Net-zero Scenario**, Canada also achieves net-zero emissions by 2050 but the rest of the world moves more slowly to reduce GHG emissions. The third scenario, the **Current Measures Scenario**, assumes limited action to reduce GHG emissions beyond measures in place today. In this scenario, we do not require our modeling results achieve net-zero GHG emissions in Canada by 2050. We also assume limited future global climate action.",

We also assume limited future global climate action.\n\nIn addition to the three main scenarios in EF2023, you will find five cases in this report that ask: “What if?” There are many uncertainties on the pathway to net-zero. These cases explore some of them by changing some key assumptions in EF2023 and showing what it could mean for Canada’s pathway to net-zero.",

The High and Low Price Cases address the uncertainty of future crude oil and natural gas prices. The Technology Case pushes past the policy and technology boundaries specific to the Reference Case and includes greater global climate policy ambition and market outcomes.

        "2016": "Four key assumptions underpin the core cases in EF2016:\n1. All energy production will find markets and infrastructure will be built as needed.\n1. Only policies and programs that are law at the time of writing are included in the projections. As a result, any policies under consideration, or new policies developed after the projections were completed in the summer of 2015, are not included in this analysis.\n1. Environmental and socio-economic considerations beyond the included policies and programs, are outside the scope of this analysis.\n1. Energy markets are constantly evolving.",
        "2016*": "The Canadian energy system is constantly changing. Factors like technology, economics, infrastructure, societal preferences, and government policy and programs continually influence how energy is produced, transported, and consumed in Canada. Chapter 2 in EF2016 (Update) describes the key assumptions and recent developments underpinning the analysis in the report.",
        "2017": "Three key assumptions underpin the analysis in EF2017:\n- Over the long term, all energy production will find markets and infrastructure will be built as needed.\n- Environmental and socio-economic considerations beyond the included policies and programs are outside the scope of the analysis.\n- EF2017 includes many recently announced climate policies. The following criteria were applied to determine whether a certain policy was included in EF2017:\n  - The policy was publically announced prior to 1 January 2017.\n  - Sufficient detail exists to credibly model a policy, or reasonable assumptions can be made about the details of a policy.\n  - Goals and targets, including Canada’s international climate targets, are not explicitly modelled. Rather, policies that are announced, and in place, to address those targets are included in the modeling.",
        "2018": "The Canadian energy system is constantly evolving. Factors such as economics, infrastructure, and societal preferences influence the production, transportation, and consumption of energy in Canada. Technology, and climate policies and programs increasingly impact energy markets. Chapter 2 in EF2018 provides an overview of recent energy market developments and climate policies. It also describes the key assumptions and recent developments underpinning the analysis in the report.",
        "2019": "EF2019 makes a variety of assumptions about future trends that are necessary to make long-term projections. These are factors such as included climate policies and regulations, rate of technological change, crude oil and natural gas markets (both domestic and global), infrastructure, major electricity projects and future costs of new generation capacity.",
        "2020": "EF2020 scenarios make a variety of assumptions about future trends necessary to make long-term projections. These include assumptions about climate policies and regulations, rate of technological change, crude oil and natural gas markets (both domestic and global), major energy infrastructure, and future costs of new electricity generation capacity.",

We developed these scenarios to explore questions that are relevant to the current Canadian energy dialogue, and to depict a range of potential outcomes for the future.\n\nThe premise of each scenario differs based on:\n1. The pace of climate action in Canada (including whether Canada must achieve net-zero emissions by 2050).\n2. The pace of climate action in the rest of the world.",

      "title": "Key Findings",
      "description": {
        "2016": "The key findings of EF2016 are outlined below and then summarized in the EF2016 Report:\n- Recent developments have highlighted numerous uncertainties for Canada’s long-term energy outlook.\n- In the Reference Case, energy production grows faster than energy use and net exports of energy increase.\n- The levels of future oil and natural gas production are highly dependent on future prices, which are subject to considerable uncertainty.\n- Without development of additional oil pipeline infrastructure, crude oil production grows less quickly but continues to grow at a moderate pace over the projection period.\n- The volume of liquefied natural gas exports is an important driver of Canadian natural gas production growth.\n- Total energy use in Canada, which includes energy use in the energy production sector, grows at similar rates in all EF 2016 cases, and GHG emissions related to that energy use will follow similar trends.",
        "2016*": "The key findings of EF2016 Update are outlined below and summarized in the EF2016 Update Report:\n- Update 2016 includes several recently announced climate policies. Future climate action remains a key uncertainty to the projections.\n- Energy use, including energy derived from fossil fuels, increases but at a slower pace compared to EF 2016.\n- The crude oil price assumptions in Update 2016 are lower to reflect recent market developments, resulting in lower crude oil production projections.\n- The electricity sector adds new wind, solar, hydro, and natural gas-fired generation to accommodate demand growth and replace coal-fired generation.",
        "2017": "The key findings of EF2017 are outlined below and summarized in the EF2017 Report:\n- The Energy Futures 2017 Reference Case is the first baseline projection in the Energy Futures series* where fossil fuel consumption peaks within the projection period.\n- Canadian fossil fuel consumption in the Higher Carbon Price Case is 8% lower than in the Reference Case, and 13% lower in the Technology Case by 2040.\n- Renewable capacity grows quickly, with wind doubling and solar more than tripling by 2040 in the Reference Case.\n- Despite different energy outcomes, economic growth is similar in all three scenarios in Energy Futures 2017.\n- Future policies and technology trends, both domestically and globally, will shape Canada’s sustainable energy future.",
        "2018": "The key findings of EF2018 are outlined below and summarized in the EF2018 Report:\n- Canada’s energy demand growth is slowing, while sources to meet these demands are becoming less carbon intensive.\n- In a scenario with greater adoption of new energy technologies, Canadians use over 15% less total energy and nearly 30% less fossil fuels by 2040.\n- Energy use and economic growth continue to decouple.\n- Canada’s energy mix continues to diversify, and its already low-emitting electricity mix adds more renewables.\n- Canadian oil and natural gas production increases in the Reference Case. Price and technology trends will be key factors influencing Canadian production in the future.",
        "2019": "The key findings of EF2019 are outlined below and summarized in the EF2019 Report:\n- Energy use grows slowly in the next 20 years. The mix of energy sources that Canadians use continues to change.\n- Oil and natural gas production grows steadily over the projection period. Assumptions on short-term infrastructure developments and long-term energy prices underlie this growth.\n- Technologies enabling Canada’s transition to a low carbon economy make inroads across the energy system.\n- Canada is making progress in transitioning towards a low carbon future.",
        "2020": "The key findings of EF2020 are outlined below and summarized in the EF2020 Report:\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the Canadian energy system. We estimate that energy use in 2020 will fall by 6% from the year prior, larger than the decrease experienced during the 2009 financial crisis. We estimate that 2020 crude oil production will decrease by 7% or 335 thousand barrels per day (Mb/d) compared to 2019.\n- Canada’s domestic fossil fuel consumption remains below 2019 levels throughout the Evolving Scenario. By 2030, it is 12% lower, and 35% lower by 2050. At the same time, renewables and nuclear grow by 31% by 2050 and become a larger share of the energy mix.\n- Electricity becomes increasingly competitive with fossil fuels in many parts of the energy system, including for passenger vehicles. Electricity’s share of end-use demand increases from approximately 16% currently to over 27% in 2050 in the Evolving Scenario, when half of all passenger vehicles sales are electric vehicles. At the same time, renewable sources account for a larger share of electricity generation.\n- Under the assumptions of the Evolving Scenario, Canadian crude oil production increases steadily until peaking in 2039 at 5.8 million barrels per day (MMb/d). Driven by growing global demand for LNG, Canadian natural gas production increases and peaks at 18.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) by 2040. Both crude oil and natural gas production decline slowly over the last decade of the projection period.\n- The major crude oil pipeline projects under construction will be able to accommodate all future production growth in both the Evolving and Reference Scenarios.\n- While fossil fuel consumption declines in the Evolving Scenario, it still makes up over 60% of Canada’s fuel mix in 2050. Achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 will require an accelerated pace of transitioning away from fossil fuels.",
        "2021": "The key findings of EF2021 are outlined below and summarized in the EF2021 Report:\n1. In the Evolving Policies Scenario, combustion of fossil fuels whose emissions are not captured falls 60% from 2021 to 2050, while use of low and non-emitting energy sources increases. While this implies a significant reduction in emissions by 2050, achieving net-zero will likely require more action than is included in this scenario.\n2. Canadians use more electricity from increasingly low-carbon sources. Despite total energy use declining by 20%, electricity demand grows 40% from 2021 to 2050 in the Evolving Policies Scenario, driven by new areas such as electric vehicles and hydrogen production. At the same time, Canada’s electricity system gets greener, going from 82% non-emitting in 2021 to 96% in 2050.\n3. Wind, solar, and battery storage dominate electric capacity additions in all six net-zero electricity scenarios, making up between 82-85% of added capacity. With rising levels of wind and solar, all scenarios require flexible generation sources to balance supply and demand. There are large differences in the types and capacities of flexible generation sources adopted among scenarios.\n4. The net-zero electricity scenarios suggest that Canadians will continue to use a range of technologies across the country, even in a low carbon future. The ten provinces meet their electricity demands in diverse ways, with varying mixes of hydro, nuclear, fossil energy with carbon capture and storage, to complement rising levels of wind and solar.\n5. In the Evolving Policies Scenario, crude oil production grows much more slowly than in the past decade, growing 16% to a peak of 5.8 MMb/d in 2032. Afterwards, production declines slowly to 2050. Crude oil available for export from Western Canada grows over the next decade and remains below the total pipeline capacity provided by existing and under construction projects.\n6. Investment for natural gas production is spurred by assumed liquified natural gas (LNG) exports in both scenarios. In the Evolving Policies Scenario, nearly 40% of Canadian natural gas production is liquefied and exported to global markets by 2050.  Despite considerable LNG-related production growth, natural gas production remains relatively stable through much of the projection period before declining gradually to reach 13.1 bcf/d by 2050, 17% lower than current levels.\n7. As Canada’s energy system decarbonizes, we use less fossil fuels. Coal becomes a negligible part of the energy mix. Use of oil-derived fuels declines, especially gasoline and diesel for transportation. Total natural gas use declines, and our consumption of natural gas is increasingly tied to the future of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Natural gas with CCS for industrial uses, power generation, and hydrogen production are key demand growth areas.",
        "2023": "The key findings of EF2023 are outlined below and summarized in the EF2023 Report:\n1. In our net-zero scenarios, the types of energy Canadians use changes dramatically, including using a lot more electricity.\n2. The electricity system, which decarbonizes by 2035 and achieves net-negative emissions thereafter, is the backbone of our net-zero scenarios.\n3. A portfolio of emerging technologies plays a key role in our net-zero scenarios, especially to address more difficult-to-reduce emissions.\n4. Canada’s oil and natural gas industry significantly reduces its emissions in our net-zero scenarios and, while production declines, the pace of global climate action determines by how much.\n5. Reaching net-zero in our scenarios is driven by increasingly strong climate policies, in Canada and abroad.",
        "default": "The key findings of EF2016 are outlined below and then summarized in the EF2016 Report:\n- Recent developments have highlighted numerous uncertainties for Canada’s long-term energy outlook.\n- In the Reference Case, energy production grows faster than energy use and net exports of energy increase.\n- The levels of future oil and natural gas production are highly dependent on future prices, which are subject to considerable uncertainty.\n- Without development of additional oil pipeline infrastructure, crude oil production grows less quickly but continues to grow at a moderate pace over the projection period.\n- The volume of liquefied natural gas exports is an important driver of Canadian natural gas production growth.\n- Total energy use in Canada, which includes energy use in the energy production sector, grows at similar rates in all EF 2016 cases, and GHG emissions related to that energy use will follow similar trends."
