# Development Document

This document is intended to be the developer portion of the
[Design Document](http://ilab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/energyvis/designdocuments/conditions/),
and will provide a breakdown of the components and functionality that make up
the visualization.

While the Design Document will provide a detailed visual representation of the
final project, the Development Document will approach the visualization from the
smallest elements first and will combine them into larger units as functionality
is completed. This will ensure that all of the functionality and accessibility
concerns are understood early in the process, and providing flexibility for
changes to meet the design requirements.

## Updates to this document

This document will be released on a regular basis, and will have a 
[Semantic Version](https://semver.org/) that aligns with the visualization as
it is developed. When providing feedback, you may use this version to provide
a common understanding of both the state of the document and visualization.

## Status of Components

Every component in this document will have a status banner above it, indicating
whether it is ready for feedback and adjustment. As some of the components are
meant to be reusable elements and do not exist in the Design Document, not all
of them will require feedback before release.

The available statuses are:

* Pending Design - We are waiting on a finalized design before we begin
  development. Many components will be started before the design is finalized.
* Functionality Under Development - We are currently working on interaction and
  accessibility, and are ignoring aesthetics.
* Design Under Development - We are currently bringing this component in-line
  with the Design Document
* Under Review - The component matches the design, or we require feedback before
  the design can be fully implemented.
* Changes Requested - Functionality or Design require changes, but they are not
  currently under development.
* Approved - Implemented design has been approved by the iLab, and is ready for
  integration into a view.
