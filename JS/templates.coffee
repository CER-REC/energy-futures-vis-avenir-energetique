  # Each viz template includes a hidden div filled with image tags for all of the icon 
  # images. The purpose is to cause the browser to cache the icons locally on page load
  # so that there is no visual delay when toggling a button from one state to the next
  # due to downloading the image.

  # TODO: should we also include the 'data unavailable' icons here in the templates?
