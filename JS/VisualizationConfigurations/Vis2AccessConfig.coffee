# Visualization 2 Accessibility Configuration

# Container for the Visualization 2 graph's accessibility state
# We track two bits of state: the year and the source.

# The accessibility config behaves much like the ordinary configs, being a store of state
# that needs perfectly reliable validation, but the rules for when the state changes
# are different.

# This state is only relevant to the visualization, and is basically internal to it,
# unlike the ordinary configurations.
